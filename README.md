### For this project, it is proposed to collect data from two APIs, which will be introduced from the Node RED, and which intend to communicate with each other so that the collected information can then be sent to another software through the OSC protocol. Therefore, the group proposes the use of an API that collects atmospheric data, OpenWeatherMap, from previously selected cities and, depending on the atmospheric state at the moment, will present a song, which equals the state of mind that can be induced by these atmospheric conditions, obtained through the Deezer API, from the Rapid API. This information will be visible through the Node RED dashboard, as well as the information from the second API will be transmitted to TouchDesigner through the OSC protocol in order to obtain graphs depending on the data received.
